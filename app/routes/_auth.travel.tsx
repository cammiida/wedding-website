            Getting to Oslo

            Oslo has two airports: Oslo Airport (Gardermoen) and Sandefjord
            Airport (Torp). Oslo Airport is the largest of the two and is the
            main international airport. There are a range of transport options
            connecting Oslo Airport to central Oslo, including bus, train, and
            car. You can read more about these options here. If you're feeling
            particularly adventurous, or you'd rather not fly, you can also get
            to Oslo via train, bus, car, and even boat.
